      God is

      My light in darkness, oh
      God, God is
      He, He is my all and all (And I'll never turn back)
      God is
      
      [Verse]
      Everything that hath breath praise the Lord
      Worship Christ with the best of your portions

      I know I won't forget all He's done
      He's the strength in this race that I run
      Every time I look up, I see God's faithfulness
      And it shows just how much He is miraculous

      I can't keep it to myself, I can't sit here and be still
      Everybody, I will tell 'til the whole world is healed
      King of Kings, Lord of Lords, all the things He has in store
      From the rich to the poor, all are welcome through the door
      You won't ever be the same when you call on Jesus' name
      Listen to the words I'm sayin', Jesus saved me, now I'm sane
      
      And I know, I know God is the force that picked me up
      I know Christ is the fountain that filled my cup
      I know God is alive, yeah
      He has opened up my vision
      Giving me a revelation

      This ain't 'bout a dead religion
      Jesus brought a revolution
      All the captives are forgiven
      Time to break down all the prisons

      Every man, every woman
      There is freedom from addiction
      Jesus, You have my soul
      Sunday Service on a roll
      All my idols, let 'em go
      All the demons, let 'em know
      This a mission, not a show
      This is my eternal soul
      This my kids, this the crib
      This my wife, this my life
      This my God-given right
      Thank You, Jesus, won the fight 
      That's what God is
